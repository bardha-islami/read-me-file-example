## Project Overview

The **eCommerce Platform** is a robust solution for creating and managing online stores. It offers everything required for modern eCommerce businesses: from handling product listings, processing customer orders, and managing inventory, to user authentication, payment integrations, and promotions.

This platform supports:

* Multiple product categories
* Secure payment processing (via Stripe, PayPal)
* Real-time order tracking
* User accounts with personalized dashboards
* Advanced search and product filtering
* Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
* Real-time reporting and analytics for business insights

## Features

### Product Management

* **Create, update, and delete products**: Admins can add new products, update existing product details, and remove obsolete products.
* **Categorize products**: Products can be grouped by categories (e.g., electronics, fashion, home & living).
* **Advanced filtering and sorting**: Admins can sort products by price, stock level, popularity, or creation date.
* **Product variants**: Products may have multiple variants (e.g., color, size) and stock for each variant is managed independently.

### User Authentication & Authorization

* **Role-based access control**: Admins, sellers, and customers have different roles with different permissions.
* **Password hashing**: Users' passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms like bcrypt.
* **Email verification**: Users must verify their email upon registration before they can make purchases.
* **OAuth login**: Option to log in via Google or Facebook for convenience.

### Shopping Cart & Checkout

* **Add/remove items**: Users can easily add or remove products from their cart.
* **Adjust quantities**: Customers can modify the quantity of products in their cart.
* **Promotions & discounts**: Customers can apply discount codes during checkout.
* **Shipping address management**: Customers can store multiple addresses and choose a shipping method.
* **Order summary**: Displays the final price, including taxes, shipping costs, and applied discounts.

### Order Management

* **Track orders**: Both customers and admins can track orders through every stage (processing, shipped, delivered).
* **Generate invoices**: Invoices are generated automatically and emailed to customers after successful purchase.
* **Returns & Refunds**: Users can initiate returns, and admins can approve or deny them.
* **Order history**: Customers can view all their past orders and statuses.

### Payment Gateway Integration

* **Multiple payment methods**: Supports Stripe (credit/debit cards) and PayPal for payment processing.
* **Secure transactions**: PCI-compliant and fully encrypted payment system.
* **Currency conversion**: Built-in support for handling multiple currencies.
* **Tax calculation**: Dynamic tax calculation based on user location.

### Analytics Dashboard

* **Sales performance**: Track total sales, daily/weekly/monthly revenue, and best-selling products.
* **User activity**: See which users are active, when they registered, and what products they’ve purchased.
* **Product performance**: View which products are frequently purchased, have the highest reviews, and are most popular.

### Customer Support Integration

* **Contact support**: Customers can directly contact support teams for assistance via email or live chat.
* **Help Center**: A knowledge base where customers can find answers to common questions.

## Technologies Used

### **Backend**

* **Node.js**: A non-blocking, event-driven server for handling large-scale requests.
* **Express.js**: A minimal web framework to handle routing and middleware.
* **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows for flexible data modeling (products, orders, users, etc.).
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and token-based authorization.
* **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB, ensuring a clear structure for data.

### **Frontend**

* **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
* **Redux**: A state management library to manage the application state centrally.
* **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor for maintaining scalable styles.
* **Axios**: For HTTP requests to the backend API.
* **React Router**: For dynamic navigation and route handling in the frontend.

### **Third-Party Services**

* **Stripe**: Payment gateway for processing credit card transactions.
* **PayPal**: Alternative payment method for users who prefer to pay using PayPal accounts.
* **SendGrid**: For email notifications (order confirmations, shipping updates, etc.).
* **Docker**: For containerizing the platform and making deployment easier.
* **Cloudinary**: For managing product images and other static content.

## Architecture

The platform follows a **Microservices Architecture** with each service being responsible for a specific feature:

### **Microservices Breakdown:**

* **Product Service**:

  * Manages product data: product creation, updating, removal, and categorization.
  * Stores product details like price, description, stock, and variants.
  * Product image storage handled via **Cloudinary**.

* **Order Service**:

  * Handles the entire order lifecycle: from creation, payment processing, order status, shipping, and returns.
  * Communicates with payment gateways like **Stripe** and **PayPal** for secure transactions.

* **User Service**:

  * Authenticates and authorizes users via **JWT tokens**.
  * Stores user data, such as login credentials, shipping addresses, and order history.
  * Offers role-based access control (admin, customer, seller).

* **Payment Service**:

  * Interfaces with third-party providers like **Stripe** and **PayPal** to process payments securely.
  * Manages payment statuses and ensures that payment verification is completed.

* **Notification Service**:

  * Handles all communication, including email notifications (via **SendGrid**) for order updates, password resets, promotions, etc.

* **Analytics Service**:

  * Collects business intelligence data and generates reports such as sales trends, customer activity, and best-performing products.

### **System Design Diagram:**

Below is a high-level system design diagram showcasing the different services and how they interact:

## System Design

### Database Design:

* **Users**:

  * Stores details about users such as name, email, password (hashed), shipping addresses, and roles.

* **Products**:

  * A collection of all the products with details like name, description, price, stock levels, and category.

* **Orders**:

  * Represents customer orders, including order status, user ID, product IDs, quantities, and total amounts.

* **Payments**:

  * Tracks payment details including the payment method, status (successful/failed), transaction ID, and amount.

* **Reviews**:

  * Stores customer reviews for each product, including rating, comments, and review date.

### Caching:

* **Redis**:

  * Used for caching frequent queries like product listings, to improve response times and reduce database load.

### API Gateway:

* An API Gateway is used to route API requests to appropriate services. This provides a single entry point for external requests and helps with load balancing, security, and performance.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/eCommerce-Platform.git
cd eCommerce-Platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and fill it with the required environment variables for database connection, JWT secret, payment keys, etc.

Example `.env` file:

```env
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce-platform
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the backend and frontend services in separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

The backend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`, and the frontend at `http://localhost:3001`.
